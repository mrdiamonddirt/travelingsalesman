    <h1>TSP</h1>
    <p>
        The travelling salesman problem (TSP) is a problem in graph theory requiring the most efficient (i.e., least total distance) Hamiltonian cycle a salesman can take through each of n cities.
        I made this Project so i could demonstrate the Problem to my Children,
        This is not a perfect implementation of the Algorithms, but it should be good enough to demonstrate the Problem.
        I may update and add more Algorithms in the Future.

    <p>
        A brute force algorithm is a technique that tries to find a solution by testing all possible solutions.

    <p>
        The nearest neighbour algorithm is a technique that starts at a random city and then repeatedly visits the nearest city until all cities have been visited.

    <p>
        A genetic algorithm is a technique that starts with a population of random solutions and then uses genetic operations to evolve the population towards better solutions.

    <p>
        A minimum spanning tree is a technique that finds a tree that connects all cities with the minimum total length.
